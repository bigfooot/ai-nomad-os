# 🚀 AI Nomad OS

> Minimal operating system for building remixable digital products using free-first tools.

AI Nomad OS is a practical, copyable system for solo builders who want to turn knowledge into **real digital products, tools, templates and micro-SaaS projects** — without unnecessary complexity.

NotebookLM → Notion → GitHub/Substack  
LAB → PROD → PUBLISH

## 🎯 What this is

This is **not consulting**.  
This is **not theory**.  
This is a **product-building operating system**.

You can use this system to build:
- Digital templates (Notion packs, prompt packs, workflows)
- Micro-tools and utilities
- AI-powered generators
- Automation kits
- Lightweight SaaS projects
- Knowledge products
- Reusable systems
- Remixable assets

Core principle:
> Build once → Remix infinitely → Keep knowledge free.
